This was my first project for the odin project. In this challenge we needed to re-construct the google homepage. The biggest challenge I found for this project was trying to get font-awesome icons inside the text-input, So far I have no worked this out. I believe 1 solution to the problem may be to put them both inside a div and set the fonts position to absolute and adjust it so that it is indide the input. 

Things I took away from this project were: 

    1. A better understanding of positioning.
    2. I got to practise with some javascript.
    3. Starting to get comfortable with knowing the right properties and selectors

I will come back to finish this project soon...
